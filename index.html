        <h2>Carbonhydrates</h2>

        <p>Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules. Along with proteins and fats, carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and drinks. Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or blood sugar, is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs.</p>
        <p>Carbonhydrates are good for the body,There is no one-size-fits-all amount of carbohydrates that people should eat. This amount can vary, depending on factors such as your age, sex, health, and whether or not you are trying to lose or gain weight. On average, people should get 45 to 65% of their calories from carbohydrates every day. On the Nutrition Facts labels, the Daily Value for total carbohydrates is 275 g per day. This is based on a 2,000-calorie daily diet. Your Daily Value may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs and health.</p>
        <p>Carbonhydrates are good for very affordable Some people go on a low-carb diet to try to lose weight. This usually means eating between 25 g and 150 g of carbs each day. This kind of diet can be safe, but you should talk to your health care provider before starting it. One problem with low-carb diets is that they can limit the amount of fiber you get each day. They can also be hard to stay on for the long term.</p>
        <p>Carbonhydrates are good for easy to get,Sugars. They are also called simple carbohydrates because they are in the most basic form. They can be added to foods, such as the sugar in candy, desserts, processed foods, and regular soda. They also include the kinds of sugar that are found naturally in fruits, vegetables, and milk.</p>
        <p>Carbonhydrates are great source of energy,Starches. They are complex carbohydrates, which are made of lots of simple sugars strung together. Your body needs to break starches down into sugars to use them for energy. Starches include bread, cereal, and pasta. They also include certain vegetables, like potatoes, peas, and corn.</p>

        <h2>Fats and oil</h2>
        
        <p>Fats and oils are made up of molecules known as triglycerides, which are esters consisting of three fatty acid units connected to glycerol. The rise in the amount of shorter chain fatty acids and/or unsaturated fatty acids reduces the melting point for fat or oil.</p>
        <p>fats and oil and vey yumilicious,Oils and fats form an important part of a healthy diet.  Structurally they are esters of glycerol with three fatty acids (called either triacylglycerols or triglycerides).  It is these fatty acids that give the functionality to fats.  Chemically, they can be divided into four main</p>
        <p>The choice of fat used in any given type of food product often comes down to the required functionality.  The main aspects of this functionality choice are (a) melting point and melting profile (how the solid fat content changes with temperature), (b) crystallization characteristics, (c) storage stability (particularly oxidative stability) and (d) nutritional characteristics.</p>
        <p>Often, there is no single natural fat, or even combination of naturally occurring fats, that give the exact functional requirements for a given product application and so oils and fats need to undergo some form of processing.  There are three main types of oil modification process used in foods.</p>
        <p>On top of all this, the oils and fats used should give rise to no adverse health concerns.  During the course of the 20th century, hydrogenation was probably the most commonly used modification process.  However, it produces high levels of trans fatty acids.  These have been shown to be adverse to health particularly in terms of their effects on blood cholesterol levels.</p>

        <h2>Fibre</h2>
        <p>Dietary fibre is found in wholegrain cereals and fruit and vegetables. Fibre is made up of the indigestible parts or compounds of plants, which pass relatively unchanged through our stomach and intestines. Fibre is mainly a carbohydrate. The main role of fibre is to keep the digestive system healthy.</p>
        <p>Fibre is a type of carbohydrate that the body cannot break down and so it passes through our gut into our large intestine (or colon). It is found naturally in plant foods like wholegrains, beans, nuts, fruit and vegetables and is sometimes added to foods or drinks.</p>
        <p>There are many different kinds of fibre, and they have different effects on our body. Some types influence how quickly food moves through our gut, adding bulk to stools and some can impact our blood cholesterol and how quickly we absorb sugar from foods and drinks, and some can influence the types and amounts of bacteria in our gut.</p>
        <p>It is recommended that adults get 30g of fibre a day, but, on average, we eat much less than this about 20g a day. Many children over the age of 2 years also need to increase the amount of fibre in their diet, although their recommended intakes are lower than for adults.</p>
        <p>To get enough fibre in our diets it is important to include a variety of fibre-providing foods regularly, such as wholemeal bread, wholegrain breakfast cereals, brown pasta or rice, fruit, vegetables, peas, beans, nuts, seeds and potatoes with skins.</p>

                <dt>brocolli</dt>
                <dd>Broccoli is a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Antioxidants can help prevent the development of various conditions. The body produces molecules called free radicals during natural processes such as metabolism, and environmental stresses add to these.</dd>

                <dt>Beans</dt>
                <dd>Beans are a great source of fiber. That's important because most Americans don't get the recommended 25 to 38 grams each day. Fiber helps keep you regular and seems to protect against heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and digestive illness. Navy beans have about 19 grams of fiber per cup.</dd>
